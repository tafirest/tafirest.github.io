# Undeniable (Douglas Axe)
## How biology confirms our intuition that life is designed.
### World Magazine book of the year

The content of this book is divided into fourteen chapters. 

## Chapter 1

The first chapter entitled The Big Question is laid over thirteen pages. In the beginning of the chapter, the author recalls an encounter with an old friend of his to introduce the notion of awkwardness ! He, also, recalls a question from his years at the university : “Which of the biological macromolecules is apt to have been the first living molecule, and why?” In the first section, Awkward Science,The author felt the awkwardness behind the statement of Darwin about evolution and the doubts and skepticism it has brought. In the first publication of Darwin’s work about natural selection, the naturalists were opposed to his ideas. Only three years later, almost all of them agreed ! The author asks questions about this change of attitude among the scientists, is it because of scientific evidence or peer pressure? In the second section, Heroic Misfits, the author praises scientists swimming against the current. He sites Thomas Nagel author of “Mind and Cosmos: Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature is Almost Certainly False”.  The third section is entitled The Big Question, simply put in these words “To what or to whom we owe our existence?” 

## Chapter 2
In Chapter 2, entitled The Conflict Within, the author starts with the “Soup”. In fact, in a slightly mocking way he introduces the “warm little pond” and evokes Darwin’s correspondence with Joseph Hooker about primordial soup. In the second section, The Universal Design Intuition summarised in the following expression by the author “Tasks that would need knowledge to accomplish can be accomplished only by someone who has that knowledge”, in this section the notion of the need of a knowledgeable creator or engineer behind every creation is discussed.
