# digitize.com
Digitization is the future of companies. I also provide an interface to manage the digitized knowledge.

This is the project I am passionate about right now. I want to create a complex software that takes companies documents, archive and generates a knowledge base of that company. This involves different aspects of computer science, first of all natural language processing. We must go through all the documents we need/want and extract concepts from those. Second of all create a knowledge graph from all the language processing phase. For each company, we would also create an ontology. The knowledge graph can communicate with the ontology and thus can reason.

## document Scanning
Maybe we should talk about document digitization instead. This approach converts on-paper data into electronic format in a first step and in a second step, transform the result into a structured data format.

# tealrn.ai

A platform mainly based on SemanticWeb

A platform relying on learning theories/taxonomies/ontologies to help teachers and educators create and tailor the best courses an exercises as well as prepare the best tests for their students. What is the technology stack we need? It will rely mostly on the work I am conducting for my PhD (Learning Ontolog(y/ies)

The decimination will be on web an mobile/tablet. A step by step process that would guide the tutor preparing the best course material. Provide a connection with different ontologies and knowledge sources to facilitate the course preparation (Wikidata and references).

# academiK.io

Research using the three or four major databases can be really hard for researchers, a platform that connect these different databases and shows the different results along with which database it occurred in with the closest papers in terms of knowledge content. How would you define the business plan for such a platform? Could you access all the articles? What if an article is not for free? Well, the subscriber should pay more for non free articles. 

Our platform will guide you through your research projects by providing you the proper tools to elaborate a related work, write a literature review, a theoretical framework as well as participate in different conferences.

All these ideas should be powered by knowledge graphs.

# dataviz.io

Visualise your data with our platform.

# learn.ai

E-learning platform to teach artificial intelligence. This platform proposes different topics and facets of AI like such: 

- History of Artificial Intelligence with emphasis on important figures (Alkhawarizmi, Aristotle) a magazine can be derived from this rubric
- Artificial Intelligence domains (ontologies, semantic web, machine learning, deep learning)
- Artificial Intelligence tools and integration with web and mobile apps
    - Computer Vision
    - Natural Language Processing

# calculus.lrn

A platform to teach calculus to university students with great tools for practicing. This platform can also include some information about the history of the taught techniques and how they have been developed by the scientists.

# artcode.co
This platform would specialise in teaching algorithmic thinking and artistic coding using tools such as Processing, Godot. 

# citybits.co

A virtual reality platform where users can scan and upload their images to build a collaborative world with other users and then visit it. CityBits enables the users to re-create parts of cities and mix them together. They can then offer visits to other users.

# literatour.io
Using semantic web and procedural content generation, we could generate environments and characters, and game scenarios directly from novels and books. This platform is a gamification knowledge-semantic-based platform. 

# jamathon.io
This mobile app helps innovators meet and jam over an idea they want to develop. This platform connects them to venture capitalists, banks and other investors as well as incubators and accelerators. 

You are a creative person, you are interested in developing an app or a product, you desire to meet people that share the same passion, Jamathon is a jam-hackathon platform that enables you to meet with innovators and creative persons like you all around the world and develop great ideas together.

This platform should be gamified as well with leader boards and scores. This app can be a "creative-tourism" tool. You travel around the world, meet new people and share your skills.

# gamify.co
Platform that guides the user through a series of questions about the topic that he/she wants to gamify. This should be powered by a knowledge graph or/and an ontology.

# kg-consulting.io
Consultant big firms
Computer scientist specialized in knowledge design and modeling, I offer my services to companies desiring to automate their processes.


# artoolbox.io
Toolbox for artists and art historians: (1) generate 3D models according to specific algorithmic thinking, (2) generate renedering params according to specific artistic impressions.
