# Writings

- It is not that you don’t like it, it is just that you don’t understand well enough (to develop)
- Materialism seduces you, drags you to an ever-ending promise-chain and leaves you in an oasis-like mirage in the middle of the desert.
- Why we follow the religion of our parents (references Boris Cyrulnik) and why we don’t trust the false abstractions and conclusion drown by biased philosophers
- Why I follow the tradition of Abraham and the strict monotheism
- Les noms de familles des français sont tout aussi éclatés que les nôtres (ceux des algériens). Faire une petite investigation sur ce sujet. Idée inspirée par Petit, Lelouche, Dujardin
- Humans are relying on a few theories written by few men. Indeed, these theories are drawn and assembled from previous work but still we take a lot of time to produce big theories and perform a paradigm shift. This is valid in physics, philosophy, economy or any other domain. This means something really important: if you perform the right amount of effort, you can revolutionise a field in the sense that you would “bend the fabric of reality” in such a way that it will take a long period after you to change that. This is can be called “changing the world”. Changing the world is such a ridiculous expression, isn’t it? But it is actually possible.
- Human knowledge is messy! 
- Did Leibniz think about the byproducts of the development of technology? (Such byproducts include the massive use of social media for awkward stuff!)
