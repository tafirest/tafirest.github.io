# From where to start?
Javascript is a programming language and constitutes one of the core technologies of the web. As of 2022, 98% of websites use javascript on the client side.

## A little bit about the Multi-paradigm aspect of Javascript

- Event-driven programming: the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads. This type of programming is easier in languages that provide high-level abstractions such as **await** and **closures**
- Functional programming: the program is constructed by applying and composing functions.



# Vue3

~~~bash
npm init vue@latest
~~~

- Typescript
- JSX Support
- Vue Router
- Pinia
- Vitest for Unit Testing
- Cypress for End-to-End testing
- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for code formatting

~~~bash
cd vue-project
npm install
npm run lint
npm run dev
~~~

## Options API

~~~html
<template>
</template>

<script setup>

export default {
    data() {
        return {
            count: 1
        }
    },
    methods: {
        increment() {
            this.count++
        }
    },

}
</script>
~~~

## Composition API
In Vue3, Composition API is introduced as an alternative to the Options API for writing component states and logic. It allows us to author Vue components using imported functions instead of declared options. It can be divided into the following:

 - Reactivity API: `ref()` and `reactive()`, allow us to directly create reactive state, computed state, and watchers
 - Lifecycle Hooks: `onMounted()` and `onUnmounted()`, allows us to programmatically hook into the component lifecycle
 - Dependency Injection: `provide()` and `inject()`, allows us to leverage Vue's dependency injection system while using Reactivity API
